## Python Starter Problems
### Problem-1: Write a program to find the length of the variable name
    

	Variable, name="Hello there"


### Problem-2: Write a program to find the type of the variable name

	name="Hello there"


### Problem-3: Write a function that takes 2 numbers as arguments (age of two brothers) and find who is elder
	Hints: Use condition inside the function



### Problem-4: Write a program to find the index of 7
	numbers=[3, 5, 1, 9, 7, 2, 8 ]



### Problem-5: Write a program to sort the numbers in Ascending order
	numbers=[3, 5, 1, 9, 7, 2, 8 ]



### Problem-6: Write a function named "isLandscape" that takes 2 numbers (image width and height) as arguments and the function returns Landscape if the image width has a higher value than height. Returns Portrait otherwise
	Hints: Use condition inside the function



### Problem-7: Write a function that takes 1 number as argument. The function should return “Fizz” if the number is divisible by 3, the function should return “Buzz” if the number is divisible by 5, the function should return “FizzBuzz” if the number is divisible by both 5 and 3, otherwise return “Not a Fizz-buzz number”
	Hints: Use condition inside the function



### Problem-8: Guessing game

Write a function that takes a number 1 to 9 from the user input (use input function inside a function). Store a number in a variable (let’s assume 6). If the input value is less than the variable, print (your guess is almost there), if the input value is greater than the variable, print - your guess is higher, if the input value and variable are equals, print - Your Guess Is Correct!



### Problem-9: Find if 6 is available in the list 
	my_list = [4, 8, 7, 4,3,6,2,1,9]




### Problem-10: The list below is the collection of the ages of people from a village. Clean up the data and store only numbers in another list.
	data_list = [13, 24, 'Karim', {'name': 'guru'}, 45, 17]


### Problem-11: Find the most frequent character in the paragraph
	rhyme = 'Twinkle, twinkle, little star. How I wonder what you are!


### Problem-12: Find the common items between the lists and make SUM of the new list items which are common between the lists.
	list1 = [3, 5, 7, 4, 8, 8]

	list2 = [4, 9, 8, 7, 1, 1, 13]



### Problem-13: Compare the two dictionaries and find the common items based on KEYs of the dictionaries
	dict1 = {'age': 13, 'id': 12, 'address': 'Banani', 'course': 'Python'}

	dict2 = {'address': 'Rupnagar', 'id': 25, 'course': 'MERN'}



### Problem-14: Sort the list in DESCENDING order and find the subtraction of maximum and minimum numbers.
	list_1 = [4, 9, 8, 7, 5, 2, 13]


### Problem-15: Write conditional statements to identify the student’s average marks. If any subject’s mark is less than 40, you should print FAILED instead of making average marks
	lstudent_1 = [40, 35, 70, 90, 56]

	student_2 = [57, 35, 80, 98, 46]
