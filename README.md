# bongoDev-lab-exercise  
A collection of exercises, labs, and practice files for DevOps, Shell scripting, python and Cloud learning  
(by bongoDev)  

## Overview  
This repo is part of my **DevOps and Cloud engineering journey**.  
I use it to store practice labs, hands-on exercises, and experiments as I learn different tools and concepts from my bongoDev devops course.  

The purpose of this repo is simple:  
- Track my progress in **DevOps, Linux, scripting with python, bash and Cloud technologies**  
- Build a hands-on reference I can revisit anytime  
- Share exercises that might help others who are also learning  

Think of it as a **work-in-progress lab notebook** â€” it grows as I learn.  

## Contents  
This repo currently includes:  
- Bash scripting tasks   
- Baisc python exercise 
- counting...

More labs will be added regularly as I go deeper into **CI/CD and others**.  

## How to Use  
Clone the repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/istiak-devsecops/bongoDev-lab-exercise.git
cd bongoDev-lab-exercise
